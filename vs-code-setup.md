# VS Code Setup Instructions

> Instructions for setting up VS Code like the EDA computers

Follow these steps in order.

## 1. Install VS Code extensions

  * ESLint
  * Remote - WSL  (Windows 10 only)
  * Live Share (online students only)
  * GitLens (optional, but recommended)
  * vscode-icons (optional, but pretty :wink:)
  * Bracket Pair Colorizer (optional, but potentially helpful)

## 2. Edit VS Code's User Settings

File :arrow_right: Preferences :arrow_right: Settings

```json
{
  "editor.tabSize": 2,
  "workbench.iconTheme": "vscode-icons",
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source.fixAll.eslint": true }
}
```

> Note: The `workbench.iconTheme` will already be there if you've _activated_ vscode-icons.

## More Notes

* The EDA computers also globally install [`git-iam`](https://npmjs.com/package/git-iam), but there is no need to install this on personal laptops/computers (only shared computers).
